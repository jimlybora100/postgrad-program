This repository contains a collection of projects I completed during my Post Graduate Program in Post Graduate Program in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Business Applications with Great Learning.

## Projects

- FoodHub  
Perform an exploratory data analysis and provide actionable insights for a food aggregator company to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants and cuisines, which will help them enhance their customer experience and improve the business

- Personal Loan Campaign
To identify bank customers with a high likelihood of purchasing a loan, you need to analyze the provided data to understand key customer attributes influencing loan acquisition. With this analysis, build a predictive model that captures patterns and customer characteristics, which will help the bank effectively target potential loan buyers, improving marketing efforts and increasing conversion rates.
